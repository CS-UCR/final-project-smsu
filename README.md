### Description of the Project
This project is based around a dataset that looks at stroke victims, and other factors that may or may not contribute to a person having a stroke.
The dataset has over 5000 entries, and tracks datapoints such as age, gender, smoking status, BMI, marital status, and other various factors, as well as whether or not the person has had a stroke  

Exploratory data analysis has been done on this dataset, to see the distribution of important variables, as well as show the correlation between those variables and having a stroke.   

Additionally, we ran the dataset through a KNN algorithm, in order to predict the chance of a given individual having a stroke when looking at certain risk factors. Along with this, we also analyzed the bias in both our dataset and our model. 

Our project is actually a hybrid of the two options that we were given. This means that we did the knn, and did bias analysis on that.  
Additionally, we did literature reviews, in which we read some research papers that were related to strokes, and implemented their models and perfomed analysis on the various methods that were discussed, looking at their efficacy, as well as the bias that they have in their models.



### How to run the code 
In order to run the code that is provided in the JupyterNotebooks, no additional libraries or dependancies are required. Running the code will install all required libraries by itself, without any extra effort needed from the person running the code.
